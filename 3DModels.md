# Introduction #

Some of the items used in this project are not common things that can be found at the local home improvement, or electronics store. As such, it is necessary to generate 3D models to prototype/create the items.  This page will detail what was used to create them

**Software**

_.scad files_ are generated using an open source program called OpenSCAD.  A wealth of information can be found on their website:  http://openscad.org/
  * Took class at NYC Resistor (http://www.nycresistor.com/) taught by **Kelly Farrell** that proved to be very helpful in understanding the basics.
  * OpenSCAD has extensive online help to assist in learning
  * While not as full featured as other programs (like Blender), it does not have a large learning curve and does what is needed for the project.

_.stl files_ are used as input to some other process (gcode?) to generate a printable model from the 3d model???
