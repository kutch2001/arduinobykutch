# Introduction #

The schematics have been created with Eagle, the free version.  This is a very powerful tool but, in my opinion, has a **LARGE** learning curve.  The little I have used it still am not comfortable with alot of the aspects of it.


# Details #

Under each project will find the .sch file for the schematic.  That should contain everything needed to view it.  The current version of the software can be downloaded from their website (http://www.cadsoftusa.com/).  It is definitely free but has a limitation when creating the pcb boards.  If need to create one over a certain size then have to purchase the license.

I took a class at NYC Resistor (http://www.nycresistor.com/) taught by **Raphael Abrams**, and despite the subject matter, was very informative.  He showed us the general ins and outs of PCB design.
