As of now, the project will store all the arduino related items I am pursuing, which is currently:
  * Customized firmware for Makerbot Cupcake 3D printer using RAMPS 1.4 electronics (based on Tonokip firmware)
  * Automatic Pet (cat) Feeder (feeduino)
  * A version of the Garduino (kutchuino) - incomplete
  * GenieMaster - override CatGenie's built-in firmware (geniemaster) - incomplete

The name in parenthesis is what to look for in name of file that is uploaded.  All files for a project will contain that name.

Have also made some changes for my MakerBot software so have included all of it here as it is somewhat arduino related..
